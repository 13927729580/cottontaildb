# Cottontail DB

Cottontail DB is a column store aimed at multimedia retrieval. It allows for classical boolean as well as vector-space retrieval (k-nearest-neighbours lookup) used in similarity search.

## Setup
Cottontail DB requires Java 11 or newer (Open JDK or Oracle JDK should both work). 

Please clone this repository using

``git clone https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb.git``

The entire project is a Gradle project and comes with a Gradle Wrapper so things should work pretty much out of the box.

### Building and starting Cottontail DB
You can simply build an executable JAR with the `./gradlew shadowJar` gradle task.
Alternatively -- preferably -- an executable distribution of Cottontail DB can then be built from sources using the 
Gradle tasks `distTar` or `distZip`. Distributions will be stored relative to the project root in `build/distributions` as either TAR or ZIP file.

Cottontail DB release artifacts (either built or downloaded from the releases page) can be started by executing `bin/cottontaildb` or `bin/cottontaildb.bat` (Windows). It requires a path to a valid configuration file as a program argument, i.e.

``bin/cottontaildb /path/to/your/config.json``

This should bring up the following cottontail CLI prompt:

```
2020-09-16 15:20:20 INFO  CottontailGrpcServer:62 - Cottontail DB server is up and running at port 1865 ! Hop along...
cottontaildb> 
```

To get a list of available commands, type `help`. Currently, there is type-ahead for commands,
schema and entity.

### Using Cottontail DB Docker Container

There is a pre-built Docker container for Cottontail DB for every release version. You can run it using the following command

``docker run --name cottontaildb -p 1865:1865 -v /path/to/volume:/cottontaildb-data docker.pkg.github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb/cottontaildb:<version>``

It is important to expose the Cottontail DB port using `-p 1865:1865` (adjust uf using a different port) and to map the data directory from the host into the container using `-v`. The data directory is expected to contain a valid `config.json` file!

Please mind, that you need to login into GitHub in order to be able to download the Docker image. See official [manual](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages) for further information

### Using Cottontail DB as Maven Dependency

You can also use Cottontail DB as Maven dependency, e.g., for use in embedded mode. Just include the following dependency descriptor:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.vitrivr</groupId>
  <artifactId>cottontaildb</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.1</version>
</dependency>
```

To start Cottontail DB in embedded mode, you can invoke `CottontailKt.embedded()` with a valid `Config` class instance.

### Configuration
All the configuration of Cottontail DB is done by means of a single configuration file. See `config.json` in project directory for structure of such a file. Most importantly, the file should contain at least the following
parameters:

* __root__: Path to the root directory used by Cottontail DB. The catalogue and all the data will be stored in this location. Hence, there must be enough space and Cottontail DB must be allowed to read and write it.
* __mapDb.enableMmap__: Determines, whether memory-mapped files should be used. Should be set to true unless it causes problems.
* __mapDb.forceUnmap__: Determines, whether MappedByteBuffers should be force-unmapped. Only valid when using memory mapped files. Should be set to true unless it causes problems.
* __mapDb.pageShift__: Size of a single data page. A value of e.g. 22 means, that a single page has 2^22 bytes.

Remaining parameters will be documented in a future version of this file. Check `org.vitrivr.cottontail.config` package for code documentation of the configuration parameters.

### Connecting to Cottontail DB
Communication with Cottontail DB is facilitated by [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). By default, the gRPC endpoint runs on **port 1865**. The server provides three different services: one for data definition (DDL), one for
data management (DML) and one for queries (DQL).

To connect to Cottontail DB, you must first generate the model classes and stubs using the gRPC library of your preference based on the programming environment you use. You can find the latest definitions [here](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb-proto).

For Kotlin and Java, there is also a Maven dependency, which includes pre-built stubs and models:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.vitrivr</groupId>
  <artifactId>cottontaildb-proto</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Once you have included that dependency, you can create a connection as follows (Kotlin code):

```kotlin
    val channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress("127.0.0.1", 1865).usePlaintext().build()
    val dqlService =  CottonDQLGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel)
    val ddlService =  CottonDDLGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel)
    val dmlService =  CottonDMLGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel)
```

The [example repository](https://github.com/vitrivr/cottontaildb-examples) points to some simple examples as to how Cottontail DB can be used.

Furthermore, the current release of Cottontail DB relies heavily on [MapDB](http://www.mapdb.org/) for internal data organization and storage.
